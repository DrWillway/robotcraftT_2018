## RobotCraft Summer Robotics School 2018 Code Collection

This repository contains code from the **RobotCraft Summer Robotics School 2018**. The projects focus on robotics tasks including navigation, control, and environment mapping. Below is an overview of the key components:

### 1. **Arduino Code**
- **PID Controller for Arduino Car with 2 Encoders**  
  Implements a PID controller to control the speed and direction of an Arduino-based car with two encoders.

- **Sonar Processing for Distance Measurement**  
  Uses sonar sensors to detect and process distances to nearby objects, helping with obstacle avoidance and environment sensing.

### 2. **ROS Melodic (C++)**
- **Reactive Navigation to Escape a Maze**  
  A reactive navigation algorithm that allows a robot to navigate and find its way out of a maze.

- **GMapping for Environment Mapping**  
  SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) implemented with GMapping, both in simulation and real-world environments, to create maps based on the robot's movement and sensor data.

### Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** for Arduino code
- **ROS Melodic** for C++ ROS components
